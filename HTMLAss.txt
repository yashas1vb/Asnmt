1.Explain the table and its properties.

Web developers can organize information like text, images, links, and other
data into rows and columns of cells using HTML tables.

The <table> tag is used to generate HTML tables. T

Table rows are created using the <tr> tag, while data cells are created using
the td> tag. Regular elements beneath <td> are by default left aligned.

2. Explain all media elements and how they work.

HTML provides various media elements to embed and display different types of media content, such as images, audio, video, and interactive elements.

Images (<img>): The <img> element is used to display images on a web page.

Audio (<audio>): The <audio> element is used to embed audio content on a web page.

Video (<video>): The <video> element is used for embedding video content.

Embed (<embed>): The <embed> element is used for embedding external media content, such as videos or interactive widgets (e.g., Google Maps).

Object (<object>): The <object> element is used for embedding multimedia objects, including audio, video, and interactive content.

Canvas (<canvas>): The <canvas> element is used for rendering graphics and animations using JavaScript.

SVG (<svg>): The <svg> element is used for scalable vector graphics and is often used for creating interactive and animated graphics.

IFrame (<iframe>): The <iframe> element is used to embed another web page within the current web page.

3. What is GET and POST in form?

GET and POST are two HTTP methods used in web forms to submit data to a server. They are used to send data from the client (typically a web browser) to the server, but they work differently and are used for different purposes.

After submitting the form, the GET method displays form values in the address
bar of the new browser tab.

It is only allowed to be roughly 3000 characters long. Only non-secure data,
not sensitive data, can be used with it.

Syntax for Get : <form method="get">


Unlike the GET method, the post method prevents form values from appearing in the address bar of the new browser tab after the form has been submitted.



Syntax for post : <form method="post">
